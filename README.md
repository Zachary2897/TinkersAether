# Tinkers' Aether: ZackPack Edition

This is a fork of [Tinkers' Aether](https://github.com/Shnupbups/TinkersAether) by Shnupbups, which is an addon for [Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) that adds support for materials from [The Aether](https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether-Archived).

## Materials
Current tool materials include:
<ul>
  <li>Skyroot</li>
  <li>Holystone</li>
  <li>Zanite</li>
  <li>Gravitite</li>
  <li>Golden Amber (as of 1.0.3)</li>
  <li>Valkyrie Metal (as of 1.1.0)</li>
  <li>Swet (as of 1.1.0)</li>
  <li>Candy Cane (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Cold Aercloud (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Blue Aercloud (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Golden Aercloud (as of 1.1.2)</li>
  <li>Icestone (as of 1.2.0)</li>
</ul>
Each of these that have corresponding tools in The Aether have traits somewhat equivalent to the abilities already existent in those.

Current fletching materials include:
<ul>
  <li>Skyroot Leaf (as of 1.2.0)</li>
  <li>Golden Oak Leaf (as of 1.2.0)</li>
  <li>Crystal Leaf (as of 1.2.0)</li>
  <li>Holiday Leaf (as of 1.2.0)</li>
  <li>Golden Feather (as of 1.2.0)</li>
</ul>
Materials can be individually disabled in the config as of Version 1.0.2.

## Dart Shooter
Currently the mod only adds one new tool, the Dart Shooter. The Dart Shooter acts much like its counterpart from The Aether, and can shoot all of its darts.

#### Darts
In addition, you can make custom darts much the same you would make other ammunition items in Tinkers' Construct, and these can also be fired from Tinkers' Dart Shooters.

Both Darts and Dart shooters can be disabled entirely in the config as of Version 1.0.2.
